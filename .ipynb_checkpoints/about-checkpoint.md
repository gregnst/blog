## Bio
My name is Gregorio Nastasi, but everyone I work with calls me Greg. <br>
I was born in Sicily, Italy, 1995. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Management and a Master's degree in Marketing, both from Bocconi University in Milan. I also spent a semester in Lausanne, Switzerland (CH), at HEC (Faculty of Business and Economics) as an exchange student.

After returning to Italy, I started working at Amazon within the Ads org as Analytics & Media Manager, a role that was later rebranded as Analytics & Insights Consultant. You can get access to my full resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15vwOa1MYKfET57H8fS0rTm2RXjxmFXF1/view?usp=sharing).

My key focus areas is the insights side of online advertising and my skills are related to:
- analytics
- data mining
- automation
- data visualization
- data science/machine learning

In terms of hobbies, I'm also a musician (bass player) and an (average) PC gamer. I also like listening to music: I rated 2500+ albums (check my RyM account below) and listened to 150k+ songs.
