## Bio
My name is Gregorio Nastasi, but everyone I work with calls me Greg. I was born in Sicily, Italy, in 1995. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Management and a Master's degree in Marketing, both from Bocconi University in Milan. I also spent a semester in Lausanne, Switzerland (CH), at HEC (Faculty of Business and Economics) as an exchange student.

After returning to Italy, I started working at Amazon Ads as an Analytics & Media Manager, a role that was later rebranded as Analytics & Insights Consultant. You can get access to my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15vwOa1MYKfET57H8fS0rTm2RXjxmFXF1/view?usp=sharing).

My key focus areas are advertising, analytics, automation, and data science/machine learning.

In terms of hobbies, I'm also a musician (bass player) and an (average) PC gamer. I also like listening to music: I rated 2500+ albums (check my RyM account below) and listened to 150k+ songs.
